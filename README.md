**Abstract:**

Alterations to the gut microbiome have been reported between children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and typically developing (TD) children. 
Characterizing these differences has led to the proposal of new treatments for ASD, such as probiotic interventions and fecal matter transplants. 
However, no study to date has characterized the gut microbiome nor metabolome in Pitt Hopkins syndrome (PTHS), a severe ASD with high incidence of 
gastrointestinal (GI) disturbance such as constipation. Here, we surveyed the gut microbiome and metabolome in a cohort of PTHS individuals and 
their unaffected parents. We focused our analysis on _C. bolteae_, a microbe previously associated with ASD known to chemically modify bile acids in 
the gut. PTHS individuals carry a higher load of _C. bolteae_ than their parents as well as both ASD- and non-ASD individuals from the American Gut 
cohort. Specific metabolites were associated with PTHS, including bile acids and sphingosines. With a metadata reanalysis tool, we found that 
PTHS-associated metabolites have previously been identified in inflammatory bowel disease and obesity patients. These results suggest microbial 
involvement in PTHS, but further research must be performed to clarify the exact mechanisms which microbes may act through. Furthermore, new 
associations between PTHS-specific metabolites and other conditions may lead to additional therapeutic options for PTHS individuals. 

**Importance:**

GI disturbances in ASD such as severe constipation can be medically significant and often require medication. This is especially true for individuals 
with PTHS, suggesting that the gut microbiome may be involved in PTHSâ€™s pathology. Revealing associations between specific gut microbes and PTHS may 
allow for the development of new therapeutics or application of existing therapeutics to ease day to day challenges encountered by PTHS individuals. 
In this study, we characterized an association between _C. bolteae_ and PTHS, in addition to metabolites linked with both PTHS and _C. bolteae_. We also 
identified other microbiome-involved medical conditions where PTHS-associated metabolites have been isolated. Utilizing common metabolites to identify 
conditions with similar phenotypes may suggest new therapeutic options for GI-related symptoms.
